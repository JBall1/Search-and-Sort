__Search-and-Sort__

_Project Statement:_ 
Design and build an autonomous vehicle that can search a space, find four
painted steel washers, and take the washers to a specified corner for each
color.


#Some rules:


Do not hit other vehicles. Do not operate the motors if they are stalled.
The beacons that identify the corners will consist of LEDs that blink at
unique frequencies.

Red washers go to the corner that flashes at 100 Hz.

Green washers go to the corner that flashes at 200 Hz.

Yellow washers go to the corner that flashes at 300 Hz

Blue washers go to the corner that flashes at 400 Hz.

Beacons will be above the fence at least 6 to 8 inches above the playing surface.
